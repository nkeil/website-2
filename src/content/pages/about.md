Hi. Since you clicked on the about tab, I'm sure that you'd like to hear all about me.

Well good, because there's a lot to get to.

My name is Nick. Or Nicolas. Whichever you prefer. Personally I prefer neither. Just awkwardly say hello to me like you forgot my name.

I make websites. Usually for money but this time I've made an exception.

I like to go outside occasionally to stand on a board with wheels and try to make it flip around.

One day I might do something cool so you should probably [be my friend](https://x.com/nickkeilhere).
