I've always wanted to make a typing practice tool so that I could tune it exactly how I wanted. This is the start of a project to do just that. A warning before you try it out: there are sound effects that will play when you type.

The typing feature is fully custom and features mistake tracking through a word-edit-distance algorithm, correct / incorrect character highlighting, and word-by-word focus adjustment.

You can find the current version on a subdomain of this website, at https://typing.nickkeil.com.
