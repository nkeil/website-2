I am not a designer. But I’m also not _not_ a designer.

Let’s start over.

<hr>

This is what my website used to look like:

![A picture of my old website](../../images/blog/3/old-site.png)
_Don't you just love whitespace?_

You probably see that and think, "yeah that’s fine". But that’s exactly my problem. It [took me a while](/blog/1) to actually get it running, but my old website was the epitome of not knowing how to represent myself and falling in line with almost every other portfolio out there.

The idea of a public persona has long been foreign to me. I haven’t used social media for most of my life, and though I hold a lot of strong opinions, I’ve usually preferred to develop them internally rather than externally.

So joining "the discourse", which in a sense my website was doing, was a big deal. _That_ was the barrier I was breaking. Just having something out there. I took a template, added some pictures, and changed some fonts around. But I didn’t have the confidence, technically or personally, to go beyond that. And I [knew this](/blog/1#get-a-first-iteration-out-asap):

> I can’t emphasize enough how much easier it is to go from v1 to v2 than it is to get v1 out. The faster you finish the first iteration, the faster you can start noticing what can be improved.

As expected, soon after publishing it, I was already thinking about all the ways I could make it better. Though I did incrementally improve it over time, there's only so many flowers you can arrange around a piece of crap before you realize you aren't going anywhere.

## 1. Opening Doors

How do you start something you have no idea how to start?

Ah the early days of web dev when everything seemed like a convoluted mess of technologies. I don’t miss having no idea how to persist a checkbox value. But now I seem to find myself here again. How the hell do I design a website?

Searching "how to design a website" on youtube gives me a plethora of relevant content:

![Searching "how to design a website" on youtube](../../images/blog/3/how-to-design-a-website.png)
_Don’t these thumbnails scream "interesting" to you?_

This has always been a problem with youtube and search engines in general. If you don’t know what you’re looking for, a general search query will give you the most bland results imaginable. You have to really be intentional to find the gems underneath all the slop. (Yes, humans were flooding the internet with mind-numbing garbage long before [AI](https://x.com/facebookaislop)).

After some days of trying to hit gold in the caves of design youtube, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zK3NYYOwaM) found its way into my feed:

![I'm Going To Tell You Exactly How To Become an Excellent Designer](../../images/blog/3/elliot-earls.png)

Clickbait aside, this guy just came across as more real than all of the other "design influencers" I was watching. He felt like someone with the experience to back up what he was saying.

The part that really stuck out to me was:

> Until you know what you’re doing, you’ve got to copy everything. Look around you at excellent examples of design and then rip them off until you get a clue.

So I copied a website.

## 2. Copying a website

Throughout this time, I’d been collecting bookmarks of blogs or sites that I found cool or that I wanted my site to look like. But opening up Figma still intimidated me. I had no idea where to start. That’s why this advice was so helpful; the bounds of an existing design creates a safety net of a clearly laid out task from which to learn from.

The one I decided to copy was this site by [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/):

It’s standard enough to be a good starting point, while still being a little alternative in terms of the navigation and page layout.

My goal was to replicate this in Figma while making a few key modifications in color palette and fonts.

Here’s what I ended up with:

![](../../images/blog/3/julia-evans-remake.png)
_Not bad, huh?_

After pulling this off, I knew the basic workflow of Figma, was getting comfortable creating layouts and choosing colors, and had dipped my toes into the vast world of font selection.

## 3. Off the Beaten Path

Now was the time to start from scratch.

Let’s start with my goals. What were my intentions with this design, and what was my high-level inspiration?

What immediately came to mind was music. Songs and albums exist at the core of almost every [facet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facet) of my life (future blog post coming soon?), so the idea of having a music-inspired website had been bouncing around my head. I wanted this site to represent me, so it should carry my spirit in its visual style.

I started with the idea of a design reminiscent of classic punk posters. High contrast, simple colors, and slightly chaotic. I collected a bunch of images from the internet that hit the aesthetic I was going for:

![](../../images/blog/3/punk1.png)

And then organized them to try and pick out some common ideas:

![](../../images/blog/3/punk2.png)

My notes were as follows:

- contrast
  - light/dark
  - different fonts
  - mess/order
- simplicity
  - limited colors
  - no gradients
  - no color photos
- in your face
  - attention-grabbing
  - aggressive imagery
- homemade feel

Seemed like a good place to start.

After finding some cool punk-inspired fonts, I came up with this v1 design:

![](../../images/blog/3/site-v1.png)
_no, I never plan on actually writing a blog post about rust_

This is actually starting to feel kind of fun.

Let me get sidetracked real quick about how I ended up with a typewriter font for the content text. I skipped the part of the story when my _first_ first idea was making a typing practice website which felt like you were typing on a typewriter. It was supposed to feel kind of dingy but also have this really sick realistic design. I wanted to use real images for the typewriter, the paper, and the background to really immerse you in the setting. It would even have an intractable lightbulb that [wouldn’t be copied at all](https://x.com/jh3yy/status/1327686213432717313). Little did I know how hard this was going to be. I lost interest around the point of trying to find an actually usable typewriter image. As much as I want to care enough to learn to type at 200WPM, I really don’t. But the typewriter font stuck around.[^1]

[^1]: To see what this idea eventually turned into, see [this post](/projects/typing-executioner). But be warned, it makes loud noises and had no design forethought whatsoever.
